# My personal Website

When creating my personal website I was a newbie. Meaning that I had never worked on a website before. Of Course I have looked at websites like "wix" and "weebly" but I haven't coded a website before with pure HTML and CSS. So as I was creating this website I was also learning how to code. It took me a while to create this website because I had never done it before. It was very nerve racking waiting to see how well the website would come out.


Moving forward I was able to learn HTML and CSS, I even took and passed a certification to show that I had  passed it:

The finalization parts of the website were the best part of the website, I ran into a few issues, but none that I couldn't overcome. I ran into issues with the designing of the website. Some of these issues include:

- Background
- Aesthetics
- Positioning
